limiting input, processing, and output:
- listing mailboxes when lots of mailboxes exist
- listing messages in a mailbox when lots of messages exist
- parsing bodystructure of a large message
  - should preprocess/cache bodystructure
- copying large messages (already using os.Link)
- limit length of line read during command during parsing
  - from rfc2683 "For its part, a server should allow for a command line of at least 8000 octets."
  - requires switching modes for reading a large literal
- avoid buffering message content
- limit amount of data read while parsing headers/envelope
- make sure flag searches are fast and indexed
- how to index message bodies?
- tls/net.conn timeouts should be appropriate. double check all connection config
- limit max number of connections


dev
- auto generated tls certs
- log errors
  - probably need to reorg. the response writing
